I've been frustrated by the lack of good cue management software for theatrical productions. The only real players that I know of are [QLab](http://figure53.com/qlab/) and [Multiplay](http://www.da-share.com/software/multiplay/). With QLab, you have to have a mac (which I neither have nor want), which can be an expensive investment for a small school or community theater. Multiplay works well enough on windows, but doesn't feel polished, and can't play any audio under `WINE`.

That is why I'm starting a new project. Introducing `SoundClip`, an Open Source audio cue playback system written in `python3`, using `GTK+3` and `gstreamer`. I hope to have an initial working verson done in time for a production I will be working on in the spring, but after that, I'd really like to flesh out the project more. Currently, I'm finishing up the project file format and the interface.

Over the next few days, I'll add some goals and planned features, but it's late, and I have to go to work tomorrow.
